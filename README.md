#README

This will be a golang program that generate markdown files in Github to static html page to be a blog. I'm trying to DIY it.:-)

If you are looking for some project to use, see [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) or another golang implementation [goblog](https://github.com/superhx/goblog)

Current process: just implement the Github Webhook and simple fsnotify.
